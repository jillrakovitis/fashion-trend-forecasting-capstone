# Fashion Trend Forecasting – Capstone Project

This project explores emerging fashion trends using computer vision and image data. I built a ResNet18 model to classify key style attributes from street-style photos and used Tableau to visualize insights for merchandising strategy.

## Tools Used
- Python (ResNet18, PyTorch)
- Tableau
- Pandas, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Deliverables
- Model: Classified silhouettes, colors, and outfit features from 400+ images
- Visuals: Tableau dashboards highlighting top trends
- Presentation: [View deck here](link-to-your-pdf-or-external-Canva-link)
